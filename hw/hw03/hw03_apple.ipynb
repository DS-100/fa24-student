We were able to see how news articles reflected trends seen in the stock market through the sentiment of the headlines. Though we used the [HuggingFace DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) model, there are thousands of NLP models available for use, and with rapid innovations in the NLP research space, there are new models frequently being created. In fact, we were using a different model for this homework one year ago, which reflects how quickly the NLP field progresses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different models evaluate sentiment differently. You may have noticed that the DistilBERT model struggles with evaluating neutral sentences and often gives sentences a high polarity score. When evaluating which models to use in your projects, it's useful to test them on small inputs of data to see how they perform, like we did by testing out various sentences! Different models may perform differently (often due to how the model was trained and created) so it's important to understand these differences when deciding what model to use for your data.\n"
